	abstract = {Posttranslational modifications of Y-box binding protein (YB)-1 are the prerequisite for its very different protein functions. Here, we investigate the underlying molecular mechanisms of YB-1 guanidinylation and link increased serum urea levels as well as the activity of glycine amidinotransferase (GATM) with guanidinylation. Computer simulations show changes in stability and conformation of the YB-1 protein induced by these modifications. In particular, the secondary structure of the doubly guanidinylated YB-1 (YB-1-2G) shows a reduced tendency to form β-sheets, and the modified cold shock domain is more exposed to the solvent. Protein–protein docking techniques in conjunction with molecular dynamics simulations confirm the binding between YB-1 and its receptor Notch-3 at EGF domains 17–24 but show no significant differences in the binding behavior of YB-1 and YB-1-2G. This is confirmed in two different types of receptor-ligand binding assays. In addition, we demonstrate for the first time a high-affinity binding of YB-1 to another ligand binding site on the Notch-3 receptor, thereby achieving effective displacement of the canonical ligand Jagged. In conclusion, we identified molecular processes that lead to the guanidinylation of YB-1 and revealed their effects on the structure and binding to receptor Notch-3.},

A recently proposed method focusing on the non-Gaussian shape of the configurational population near equilibrium projects this information onto real space in order to identify the aminoacids relevant to function. We here apply this method to three ancestral proteins in glucocorticoid receptor (GR) family and show that the mutations that restrict functional activity during GR evolution correlate significantly with locations that are highlighted by the nonlinear contribution to the near-native configurational distribution. Our findings demonstrate that the analysis of nonlinear effects in protein dynamics can be harnessed into a predictive tool for functional site determination.},

PST initiates apoptosis while leaving healthy, noncancerous cells unscathed. However, the manner by which PST induces apoptosis remains elusive and impedes the advancement of PST as a natural anticancer therapeutic agent. Herein, we use neutron spin−echo (NSE) spectroscopy, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and supporting small angle scattering techniques to study PST’s eﬀect on membrane dynamics using biologically representative model membranes. Our data suggests that PST stiﬀens the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) by being preferentially associated with cardiolipin, which would lead to the relocation and release of cytochrome c. Second, PST has an ordering eﬀect on the lipids and disrupts their distribution within the IMM, which would interfere with the maintenance and functionality of the active forms of proteins in the electron transport chain. These previously unreported ﬁndings implicate PST’s eﬀect on mitochondrial apoptosis.},

We show large discrepancies between diﬀerent force ﬁelds and that none of them reproduces the NMR data within experimental accuracy.

	abstract = {There is mounting evidence that Alzheimer's disease progression and severity are linked to neuronal membrane damage caused by aggregates of the amyloid-β (Aβ) peptide. However, the detailed mechanism behind the membrane damage is not well understood yet. Recently, the lipid-chaperone hypothesis has been put forward, based on which the formation of complexes between Aβ and free lipids enables an easy insertion of Aβ into membranes. In order to test this hypothesis, we performed numerous all-atom molecular dynamics simulations. We studied the complex formation between individual lipids, considering both POPC and DPPC, and Aβ and examined whether the resulting complexes would be able to insert into lipid membranes. Complex formation at a one-to-one ratio was readily observed, yet with minimal effects on Aβ's characteristics. Most importantly, the peptide remains largely disordered in 1:1 complexes, and the complex does not insert into the membrane; instead, it is adsorbed to the membrane surface. The results change considerably once Aβ forms a complex with a POPC cluster composed of three lipid molecules. The hydrophobic interactions between Aβ and the lipid tails cause the peptide to fold into either a helical or a β-sheet structure. These observations provide atomic insight into the disorder-to-order transition that is needed for membrane insertion or amyloid aggregation to proceed.},

            Force generation by active biological materials, in particular through native protein polymerization, is a key feature of cellular function and motility. Protein polymerization to form amyloid fibrils is associated with a number of devastating and currently incurable protein misfolding diseases. Unlike the polymerization of actin and tubulin driving cell motility, little is known about the mechanical properties of amyloid fibril growth. Here, we present direct experimental measurements of the force generated by growing amyloid fibrils. These measurements demonstrate that amyloid growth can release comparable forces to actin and tubulin polymerization. This conclusion is remarkable as actin and tubulin, unlike proteins forming amyloid fibrils, have evolved to generate force.
          , 
            The generation of mechanical forces are central to a wide range of vital biological processes, including the function of the cytoskeleton. Although the forces emerging from the polymerization of native proteins have been studied in detail, the potential for force generation by aberrant protein polymerization has not yet been explored. Here, we show that the growth of amyloid fibrils, archetypical aberrant protein polymers, is capable of unleashing mechanical forces on the piconewton scale for individual filaments. We apply microfluidic techniques to measure the forces released by amyloid growth for two systems: insulin and lysozyme. The level of force measured for amyloid growth in both systems is comparable to that observed for actin and tubulin, systems that have evolved to generate force during their native functions and, unlike amyloid growth, rely on the input of external energy in the form of nucleotide hydrolysis for maximum force generation. Furthermore, we find that the power density released from growing amyloid fibrils is comparable to that of high-performance synthetic polymer actuators. These findings highlight the potential of amyloid structures as active materials and shed light on the criteria for regulation and reversibility that guide molecular evolution of functional polymers.},

            Tools based on artificial intelligence (AI) are currently revolutionising many fields, yet their applications are often limited by the lack of suitable training data in programmatically accessible format. Here we propose an effective solution to make data scattered in various locations and formats accessible for data-driven and machine learning applications using the overlay databank format. To demonstrate the practical relevance of such approach, we present the NMRlipids Databank—a community-driven, open-for-all database featuring programmatic access to quality-evaluated atom-resolution molecular dynamics simulations of cellular membranes. Cellular membrane lipid composition is implicated in diseases and controls major biological functions, but membranes are difficult to study experimentally due to their intrinsic disorder and complex phase behaviour. While MD simulations have been useful in understanding membrane systems, they require significant computational resources and often suffer from inaccuracies in model parameters. Here, we demonstrate how programmable interface for flexible implementation of data-driven and machine learning applications, and rapid access to simulation data through a graphical user interface, unlock possibilities beyond current MD simulation and experimental studies to understand cellular membranes. The proposed overlay databank concept can be further applied to other biomolecules, as well as in other fields where similar barriers hinder the AI revolution.},

There is a wide variety of protein force fields and ion models, raising the question of which model to use in such studies. To address this question, we perform molecular dynamics simulations of Aβ16–22, a fragment of the Alzheimer's amyloid β peptide, using different protein force fields, AMBER99SBdisp (A99-d) and CHARMM36m (C36m), and different ion parameters. The influences of NaCl and CaCl2 at various concentrations are studied and compared with the systems without the addition of ions. Our results indicate a sensitivity of the peptide-ion interactions to the different ion models. In particular, we observe a strong binding of Ca2+ to residue E22 with C36m and also with the Åqvist ion model used together with A99-d, which slightly affects the monomeric Aβ16–22 structures and the aggregation rate, but significantly affects the oligomer structures formed in the aggregation simulations. For example, at high Ca2+ concentrations, there was a switch from an antiparallel to a parallel β-sheet. Such ionic influences are of biological relevance because local ion concentrations can change in vivo and could help explain the polymorphism of amyloid fibrils.},

	abstract = {Glycolipids mediate stable membrane adhesion of potential biological relevance. In this article, we investigate the trans- and cis-interactions of glycolipids in molecular dynamics simulations and relate these interactions to the glycolipid-induced average separations of membranes obtained from neutron scattering experiments. We ﬁnd that the cis-interactions between glycolipids in the same membrane leaﬂet tend to strengthen the trans-interactions between glycolipids in apposing leaﬂets. The transinteractions of the glycolipids in our simulations require local membrane separations that are signiﬁcantly smaller than the average membrane separations in the neutron scattering experiments, which indicates an important role of membrane shape ﬂuctuations in glycolipid trans-binding. Simulations at the experimentally measured average membrane separations provide a molecular picture of the interplay between glycolipid attraction and steric repulsion of the ﬂuctuating membranes probed in the experiments.},

	abstract = {Binding forces between biomolecules are ubiquitous in nature but sometimes as weak as a few pico-Newtons (pN). In many cases, the binding partners are attached to biomembranes with the help of a lipid anchor. One important example are glycolipids that promote membrane adhesion through weak carbohydrate−carbohydrate binding between adjacent membranes. Here, we use molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to quantify the forces generated by bonds involving membrane-anchored molecules. We introduce a method in which the protrusion of the lipid anchors from the membrane acts as the force sensor. Our results with two different glycolipids reveal binding forces of up to 20 pN and corroborate the recent notion that carbohydrate− carbohydrate interactions are generic rather than specific.},

	abstract = {Amyloid proteins are characterized by their tendency to aggregate into amyloid fibrils, which are often associated with devastating diseases. Aggregation pathways typically involve unfolding or misfolding of monomeric proteins and formation of transient oligomers and protofibrils before the final aggregation product is formed. The conformational dynamics and polymorphic and volatile nature of these aggregation intermediates make their characterization by experimental techniques alone insufficient and also require computational approaches. Over the past 25 years, the size of simulated amyloid aggregation systems and the length of these simulations have increased significantly. These advances are discussed here. The review includes simulation approaches that model the aggregating peptides or proteins at both the all-atom and coarsegrained levels, use molecular dynamics simulations or Monte Carlo sampling to simulate the conformational changes, and present results for various amyloid peptides and proteins ranging from Lys-Phe-Phe-Glu (KFFE) as the smallest system to Aβ as an intermediate-sized peptide to α-synuclein. The presentation of the history of amyloid aggregation simulations concludes with a discussion of where the future of these simulations may lie.},
